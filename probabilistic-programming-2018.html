# Introduction

 * Software for Bayesian inference often makes use of streams of random numbers

  * PyMC3, Stan, BUGS, etc.

 * What are all those numbers for?

  * Why are we generating random numbers?

 * I'll talk about the motivation for all that random stuff, and talk a little about alternatives.

---
# Motivation 1

 * We need random numbers to compute integrals

  * Summation = adding up discrete items, integral = adding up continuous items

 * Next question follows immediately, why are we computing integrals?

---
# Motivation 2

 * At a fundamental level, we need integrals because `\(P(A \mathrm{or} B) = P(A) + P(B) + P(A \mathrm{and} B)\)`

  * When A and B are mutually exclusive, `\(P(A \mathrm{and} B) = 0\)`, so `\(P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)\)`

 * Suppose `\(A\)` is the union of mutually exclusive `\(A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots, A_n\)`

  * Then `\(P(A) = \sum_{k=1}^n P(A_k)\)`

 * Suppose `\(A\)` is divided into infinitesimal bits, then `\(P(A) = \int_A P(x) dx\)`

---
# Examples of integrals in probability problems, in words

 * Find probability that some parameter falls in a specified set

  * e.g. parameter is positive, parameter is below a threshold, parameter is within certain distance of a point

 * Make a prediction about an interesting variable, averaging over less-interesting parameters

  * e.g. rainfall as a function of elevation and temperature from a multi-parameter model

  * e.g. mechanical failure as a function of observed sensor values from a model incorporating previous mechanical states

 * Compute expected cost of some action, averaging over unknown states of nature

  * Estimate operating cost of a car, averaging over wear and tear, accidents, future price of fuel

  * Estimate net benefit of planting millions of trees, with future climate and effect of trees unknown

---

 * What all these examples have in common is the need to compute total amounts or averages over some variables

 * These totals or averages are represented as integrals

 * Let's rephrase the previous examples as formulas involving integrals

---
# Examples of integrals, as math formulas

 * `\(P(A) = \int_A P(x) dx\)`

 * Given `\(P(A, B)\)`,

  * `\(P(A) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} P(x, B) dx\)`
 
  * Deriving `\(P(A)\)` from `\(P(A, B)\)` is called `marginalizing'

 * `\(E[f] = \int_{-\infty}^{infty} P(x) f(x) dx\)`

  * `\(E[f]\)` is the expected value of `\(f(x)\)` with respect to `\(P(x)\)`

 * Bayes' theorem (simplest form):

  * `\(P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(B | A) P(A)}{\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} P(B | A) P(A = x) dx}\)`

  * Calculation of normalizing constant requires marginalizing

---

 * The previous examples were all stated for one variable

 * Often enough, we'll need to integrate over multiple variables

  * e.g. `\(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} P(A, B = x, C = y, D, E = z) dx dy dz\)`

 * There will always be one dimension per unknown variable, and any number of unknowns

  * therefore any number of dimensions of the integral

---
# Back to motivation 1

 * Random numbers can help us compute integrals such as `\(\int_A P(x) dx\)`
